Intro to this repository

This repo was created by me to track and document practicals/labs for cybersecurity in the hopes of helping me land a job and finally start my career in this field. For this repo I will list the labs I have done, what I 
did in the labs, results from the labs, and finally what I learned from preforming the lab. This is my first time creating a Github repo for something like this so ill be in the process of trying to set things or format 
them the way I want them to be until I get used to how this works. 

My projects will start off small with things like scanning my own network using Nmap or getting more familiar with Kali Linux etc. To later down the line where I would have more advanced projects.
